# Goodix 27c6:550c Linux driver lab

This project enables the USB fingerprint reader in a Lenovo Yoga 9 14IAP7. Linux
enumerates the hardware as `27c6:550c`, but upstream `libfprint` does not bind a
driver to it.

There are three deliberately separated layers:

- a tightly allow-listed Python identity/backup probe that cannot reset or configure
  the sensor; and
- an isolated `libfprint` 1.94.10 build for the exact `550c` that can perform a
  TLS open, enrollment, and verification. Persistent mutation is denied at the
  transport boundary, and volatile initialization needs both a build-time and a
  runtime opt-in; and
- a source-recompiled external TOD module for Ubuntu's exact
  `libfprint 1.95.1+tod1` runtime. It leaves Ubuntu's core library and `fprintd`
  untouched and has a private-D-Bus smoke mode in which USB is not visible.

## Set up

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -e '.[dev,reverse,dpapi]'
.venv/bin/pytest
```

Fetch and verify the exact public source revisions used by both native builds:

```bash
scripts/fetch_upstream_sources.sh
```

That command initializes only ignored directories below `research/upstream/` and
performs depth-one fetches of these immutable revisions:

| Source | Public URL | Revision |
|---|---|---|
| Goodix 550c driver | `https://github.com/brianporeilly/goodix-550c-driver.git` | `a3de5a1b6174ace5db0bb2a8796c5be6e55428f0` |
| libfprint | `https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/libfprint/libfprint.git` | tag `v1.94.10`, commit `0c97a47d8ef405cd577b87058c1e89cae9d242e7` |

Use `scripts/fetch_upstream_sources.sh --offline` to verify cached clones without
network access. Build scripts refuse missing inputs and point back to this command;
they also independently verify the pinned commits before archiving any source.

The native driver build additionally needs Meson/Ninja, GLib/GIO, GUsb, OpenSSL,
and the OpenCV core/features2d/flann/imgproc development components. On this host:

```bash
scripts/build_goodix550c_libfprint.sh \
  --allow-volatile-init \
  --allow-manual-fdt-poll \
  --stage-dir build/goodix550c-13021-manual-fdt-v7
```

The build stays below `build/`; it neither installs nor runs the driver. Its
minimal exact-device harness is emitted as
`build/goodix550c-13021-manual-fdt-v7/builddir/goodix550c-open-close`.
Before emitting that harness, the build runs offline native regressions for the
paired TLS channel and for the patched production FDT-down command path. The latter
compiles the actual Goodix command and protocol encoder sources, replaces only USB
submission with an in-memory capture, and checks the complete firmware-13021 wire
frame.

After confirming fprintd is inactive and no process/driver owns the USB interface,
the guarded live open can be repeated with:

```bash
sudo chown root:root research/secrets/goodix550c.psk
sudo scripts/run_goodix550c_open_close.sh \
  --stage-dir build/goodix550c-13021-manual-fdt-v7 \
  --psk-file research/secrets/goodix550c.psk \
  --allow-volatile-init
sudo chown bart:bart research/secrets/goodix550c.psk
```

`--allow-volatile-init` is required for each run; the volatile USB/MCU reset gate
is never enabled without that explicit acknowledgement. `--allow-manual-fdt-poll`
is accepted but optional here, because this harness only opens and closes and
reaches no manual-FDT state; pass it only to reproduce the exact live environment,
and omit it for a control run against a manual-FDT stage. The runtime gate
`GOODIX550C_ALLOW_MANUAL_FDT_POLL=1` is exported only when the flag is given, and
any inherited value is cleared. The wrapper stops nothing: any holder, bound
interface driver, or active fprintd causes refusal.

This isolated 1.94.10 path exists to validate the driver against a build-tree
library. For a live open against Ubuntu's *installed* runtime, prefer the guarded
TOD open/close under "Guarded physical TOD open/close" below: that wrapper adds
build-metadata, module/harness digest, source-drift, package-version, and exact
endpoint checks that this isolated wrapper does not perform.

The manual fallback is firmware-13021-specific and requires both the compile-time
option above and runtime value `GOODIX550C_ALLOW_MANUAL_FDT_POLL=1`, which the
guarded wrapper supplies only after the explicit flag. Keep the pad fully clear
during open and the pre/post-reference baseline phases, and do not suspend the
machine during the experiment. Manual responses are classified only from two
consecutive raw 24-byte readings; the device's touch flag is ignored because it
was observed nonzero with hands clear. No raw readings or per-channel metrics are
logged or persisted.

Neither reference-baseline phase waits forever: each fails the action after 100
polls (10 s), and the finger-up wait fails after 600 polls (60 s), so a pad that
never settles ends in an error instead of an endless USB poll. Only the
finger-down wait is deliberately unbounded, matching the asynchronous path it
replaces; it ends on cancellation. If the machine is suspended while a poll owns
the device, the driver now refuses the suspend rather than reporting one it cannot
honor, and the in-flight action fails at its next cancellation check.

## Ubuntu 26.04 TOD module without USB access

The preferred integration artifact is `libgoodix550c.so`, an external TOD driver
for the installed `fprintd 1.94.5-4` and
`libfprint 1:1.95.1+tod1-0ubuntu2`. The build refuses a different architecture or
runtime package version. It recompiles the exact fail-closed source allowlist
against verified Ubuntu headers; it does not reuse 1.94.10 object files or replace
the installed core library.

Fetch and verify the two pinned public development packages, then build with the
volatile path compiled out:

```bash
scripts/fetch_ubuntu_tod_sdk.sh
scripts/build_goodix550c_tod_module.sh \
  --offline-sdk \
  --stage-dir build/goodix550c-tod-default-off
```

The package digests are pinned in the fetcher. All downloads, extracted headers,
patched sources, binaries, and metadata remain below `build/`. The build runs a
source-policy audit, an exact core/TOD ABI audit, and the offline paired TLS test.
It never installs the module or invokes fprintd.

The loader and D-Bus integration can be tested without exposing the host's USB
devices:

```bash
scripts/smoke_goodix550c_tod_fprintd.sh \
  --module build/goodix550c-tod-default-off/builddir/libgoodix550c.so \
  --run-dir build/goodix550c-tod-smoke
```

This starts only a directly executed fprintd and a non-activating private bus, both
as recorded child processes. Bubblewrap supplies a fresh `/dev`, empty `/sys`,
`/run`, and `/tmp`, a read-only host root, and an empty overlay at the checkout
path. Only the dedicated smoke run directory is rebound at
`/run/goodix550c-tod-smoke`; assertions prove `.env` and `research/secrets` are not
visible. The environment is rebuilt from empty, so no PSK is inherited. Cleanup
checks shell-job ownership plus `/proc` parent, start-time, and executable identity
before it signals either recorded child; no system service is queried, stopped, or
restarted.

Two independent hardened default-off builds produced identical module SHA-256
`d2c473c98b47bae29fceed2532002d8cccbd6d8911a495de8dc1b293401abd5a`
and identical installed-runtime harness SHA-256
`bf0f4e6d079f636a77182f1ad4140ff0b77a93d4b5ddf93537dc6176071dfc66`.
This module digest reflects the full `driver-series` including patch `0005`,
whose manual-FDT source is present but compile-gated off in a default-off build.
The no-USB smoke loaded driver ID `goodix53x5` through the installed TOD loader and
returned an empty device array, as required. This validates loading and D-Bus
plumbing only; installation and physical-device testing remain separate,
explicitly authorized phases.

## Guarded physical TOD open/close

Build a separate module with volatile initialization compiled in. This still
installs and runs nothing:

```bash
scripts/build_goodix550c_tod_module.sh \
  --offline-sdk \
  --allow-volatile-init \
  --allow-manual-fdt-poll \
  --stage-dir build/goodix550c-tod-manual-fdt-v3
```

The build also emits `goodix550c-tod-open-close`, a PIE linked directly to the
installed Ubuntu core and TOD SONAMEs without an RPATH. The physical wrapper
requires a fresh command-line opt-in, verifies module, harness, and project-relative
tracked-input manifests, reruns the source/ABI audit, compares the decoded PSK to
the independent live hash oracle without printing either, and checks the exact USB
interface and endpoints.
It refuses an active fprintd, a bound interface, or any process holding the USB
node; it never stops any of them.

```bash
sudo chown root:root research/secrets/goodix550c.psk
sudo scripts/run_goodix550c_tod_open_close.sh \
  --stage-dir build/goodix550c-tod-manual-fdt-v3 \
  --psk-file research/secrets/goodix550c.psk \
  --expected-psk-hash research/artifacts/psk-hash-current.json \
  --allow-volatile-init
sudo chown bart:bart research/secrets/goodix550c.psk
```

This run needs no finger: the harness opens the device and closes it, and reaches
no manual-FDT state. Keep the pad clear for the whole run.

As with the isolated wrapper, `--allow-manual-fdt-poll` is accepted but optional
and changes nothing an open/close can reach; the runtime gate is exported only when
it is given. Only the project-local module is exposed to the installed TOD loader.
The initial USB reset remains behind the volatile opt-in; after that reset and
firmware read, the driver requires `GF5288_GM168SEC_APP_13021` before MCU reset,
register writes, or configuration upload. A successful PSK-TLS handshake is required
before open can pass. The wrapper uses project-local HOME/TMP/XDG directories, a
rebuilt environment, and a 45-second bound; it performs no installation or
persistent sensor command. Its per-run private directory under `build/` is removed
on every exit path.

## Guarded enrollment capture test

This is the only command that reads a finger. It runs `fp_device_enroll_sync`
through the same guarded wrapper and **discards the template**: nothing is stored,
printed, or hashed. It is a capture test, not a way to register a fingerprint.

```bash
sudo scripts/run_goodix550c_tod_open_close.sh \
  --stage-dir build/goodix550c-tod-capture-diag \
  --psk-file research/secrets/goodix550c.psk \
  --expected-psk-hash research/artifacts/psk-hash-current.json \
  --allow-volatile-init \
  --allow-manual-fdt-poll \
  --enroll --debug
```

`--enroll` requires `--allow-manual-fdt-poll`. `--debug` adds driver diagnostics; it
logs no key, raw reading, image, or template. The run is bounded at 240 seconds.

Operating it, in order:

1. Keep the pad **completely clear** until the harness prints
   `>>> PLACE your finger on the sensor now`. Before that it establishes two
   no-finger reference baselines, and contact corrupts them.
2. Rest your finger on the sensor. No need to press hard — the driver waits
   `GOODIX_MANUAL_FDT_DOWN_SETTLE_MS` (300 ms) for the contact to settle before it
   reads the pad.
3. Lift as soon as it prints `>>> LIFT your finger off the sensor.` The finger-up
   wait is bounded at 600 polls (60 s); holding past that fails the enrollment.
4. Repeat for all 8 stages.

Watch the harness output directly. Its prompts fire at the moment the operator must
act, so anything that relays them second-hand adds latency against that 60 s bound.

Current state: **a full 8-stage enrollment passes**, zero rejections, every frame at
0.0% non-contact. If a stage is ever rejected with "the finger was not centered
properly", that is the coverage gate reporting real partial contact — do not work
around it by loosening `GOODIX_ENROLL_MAX_CLIPPED_FRACTION`, which would enroll
unusable templates and raise false-accept risk. See DOCUMENTATION.md for the
measurements.

## Guarded verification test

Same wrapper, `--verify` instead of `--enroll`. It enrolls, keeps the template
**in process memory only**, then matches live fingers against it. Neither the
template nor any scanned print is stored, printed, or hashed.

```bash
sudo scripts/run_goodix550c_tod_open_close.sh \
  --stage-dir build/goodix550c-tod-wake \
  --psk-file research/secrets/goodix550c.psk \
  --expected-psk-hash research/artifacts/psk-hash-current.json \
  --allow-volatile-init \
  --allow-manual-fdt-poll \
  --verify --debug
```

Eight enrollment placements, then three match trials: two with the enrolled finger
and one with a **different** finger, because a positive-only test would pass against
a driver that matched everything. Bounded at 420 seconds.

Current state: the **first** verification of a session matches correctly. Every later
one in the same session fails because the device stops answering image requests — an
all-zero reference frame and a 95.2% railed capture. The rejection trial has not yet
returned a verdict, so nothing is claimed about false accepts. See DOCUMENTATION.md.

## Fingerprint app (private fprintd)

The harnesses above are capture tests that discard everything. This is the real
thing: the installed fprintd, running on a private non-activating D-Bus with only
the project-local TOD module loaded, driven by fprintd's own client tools.

```bash
sudo scripts/goodix550c_fprintd_app.sh \
  --stage-dir build/goodix550c-tod-cover \
  --psk-file research/secrets/goodix550c.psk \
  --allow-volatile-init --allow-manual-fdt-poll \
  --enroll --finger right-index-finger
```

Swap `--enroll` for `--verify`, `--list` or `--delete`. Prompts come from fprintd
and appear directly in your terminal, so run it yourself rather than through an
assistant relay — the finger-up wait is bounded and relayed cues arrive too late.

`--gui` opens a dark-themed window instead, with the finger picker, a progress bar
and Enrol/Verify/Stop/Delete buttons. "Verify against any enrolled finger" is on by
default, which is what a login gate does; with it off, verification loads only the
named slot. That distinction matters if you store extra passes of one finger under
spare slots to improve coverage, because a named verify would never look at them. That is the only mode whose prompts are
visible when somebody other than the operator starts the session, because a
terminal program can only prompt in a terminal its own operator is attached to.
The window runs as the desktop user while the daemon runs as root for USB, so the
session bus permits both uids and its socket is reachable by both; it is per-run,
non-activating, and carries no secret, since the PSK reaches the driver by file and
environment rather than over the bus.

**This stores fingerprints**, unlike everything else in the project. Templates live
in `build/goodix550c-fprintd-state/prints`, which is git-ignored; delete that
directory to remove every template. The host `fprintd.service` is never started,
stopped, or contacted, nothing is installed system-wide, and the driver's
fail-closed policy is unchanged.

fprintd asks PolicyKit before every device method, and a private bus has no polkit
on it, so `scripts/goodix550c_private_polkit.py` answers on that socket alone. It
authorizes `net.reactivated.fprint.*` and refuses everything else.

## Offline packet preview

This produces the exact bytes without opening the USB device:

```bash
.venv/bin/goodix550c packets
```

## Offline recovery of the existing Windows PSK

The recovery utility performs no USB I/O. It reads the captured 324-byte slot
`0xbb010002` DPAPI blob and the matching offline Windows DPAPI hives/master keys,
then requires the plaintext's SHA-256 to match the separately captured live hash
oracle from slot `0xbb020001`. It never prints the PSK.

The Windows source must be exposed through a repository-local read-only mount. That
bind is currently not mounted; do not run recovery until it has deliberately been
re-established read-only. Check the mount and machine-key prerequisites first:

```bash
findmnt .dpapi-windows-ro
.venv/bin/python scripts/recover_windows_dpapi_psk.py --preflight
```

Verify and discard the plaintext immediately:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/recover_windows_dpapi_psk.py
```

Or explicitly create a driver-compatible hex key, mode `0600`, under the ignored
secret directory:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/recover_windows_dpapi_psk.py \
  --blob research/secrets/psk-dpapi.bin \
  --expected-hash research/artifacts/psk-hash.json \
  --output research/secrets/goodix550c.psk
```

The utility refuses a writable Windows source, output outside `research/secrets`,
existing output files, malformed or wrong-slot E4 data, DPAPI integrity failure, and
any mismatch with the live sensor hash. Its Impacket registry adapter opens the
SYSTEM and SECURITY hives with `rb`, not Impacket's default `r+b` mode.

On this machine the independent recovery run passed both DPAPI integrity and the live
hash-oracle check. The resulting `research/secrets/goodix550c.psk` is ignored by Git,
65 bytes of driver-compatible lowercase hex plus newline, and mode `0600`. Its
contents must never be printed, logged, or committed.

## Live, read-only identity probe

The probe sends only a protocol NOP and a firmware-version request. USB access normally requires root until a dedicated udev rule exists:

```bash
sudo .venv/bin/goodix550c probe \
  --i-understand-this-sends-two-read-only-requests \
  --output research/artifacts/live-probe.json
```

Do not run any upstream `goodix-fp-dump` driver script against this sensor. It does not support PID `550c`, and several scripts intentionally erase and replace firmware.

## Proven live path

On this machine, the recovered Windows PSK has completed a real TLS handshake with
firmware `GF5288_GM168SEC_APP_13021`; volatile initialization and close both
succeeded using the isolated build. As of 2026-08-13 the same open/close also
passes through Ubuntu's *installed* `libfprint 1.95.1+tod1` runtime via the TOD
module, three consecutive runs with the pad clear. No firmware, PSK, or production
data was written, and no system library or service was changed. No fingerprint has
been read under Linux: enrollment and verification are still unbuilt.

If an open ever fails with `error:1C800066:Provider routines::cipher operation
failed`, the sensor is holding a stale TLS session rather than rejecting the key.
Run the read-only probe once and retry:

```bash
sudo .venv/bin/goodix550c identify psk-hash \
  --i-understand-this-sends-two-read-only-requests
```

enrollment/verification procedure.
